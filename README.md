To run this repository, download the files present here.<br>
Place the main.py folder in the API folder in the root folder.<br>
Create a svelte skeleton app and replace the routes folder with the folder downloaded from here.<br>
In the static folder of the svelte app, create two new folders: query and target<br>
Now run the svelte app and upload the images. After each upload, click the submit button present just right to the upload.<br>
After uploading all the files, click on the final submit button, which is at the bottom<br>
This will create a folder called crop, which contains all the images. Before each new run, kindly delete the cropped folder.<br>
